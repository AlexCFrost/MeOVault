# MeOVault

MeOVault is an AI-powered personal knowledge system designed to act as a second brain. Unlike traditional note-taking applications that rely on exact keywords or tags, MindVault understands the intent and context behind your thoughts using semantic embeddings. This allows users to rediscover ideas even when they don’t remember the exact words they originally used.

Problem Statement

Traditional note applications fail when users forget:

the exact keywords they used

how they phrased an idea

which tag they assigned to a note

As a result, valuable thoughts are often lost inside the system.

MindVault solves this by using vector embeddings to store and retrieve notes based on meaning, not keywords.

Core Idea

Every note is converted into a mathematical representation (embedding).
Search queries are also converted into embeddings.
Notes are retrieved based on semantic similarity in vector space rather than text matching.
